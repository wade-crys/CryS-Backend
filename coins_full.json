When running on the blockchain a smart contract becomes like a self-operating computer program that automatically executes when specific conditions are met. On the blockchain, smart contracts allow for code to be run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interference.

Although based on Bitcoin, adjustments in the code reportedly allow for improved functionality, including 15-second block time, real-time difficulty adjustment and improved security. DigiByte development has included DigiShield, MultiAlgo, MultiShield, SegWit, and Odocrypt. \r\n\r\nDigiByte claims to have never been funded through an ICO, presale, or token sale. DGB is the Digital Asset/ Cryptocurrency with a 1000:1 ratio to BTC that is being mined over 21 years (2014-2035) with a max supply of 21B in the year 2035. DigiAssets was designed to allow users to build on top of DigiByte as a secondary layer on top of the global DigiByte blockchain to enable the decentralized issuance of assets, tokens, smart contracts, and digital identity.\r\n\r\nDigiByte claims to have had 280,000 full node downloads since 2017. As of 21 August 2019. 12,000 nodes are reportedly active and the network is distributed by 5 parallel cryptographic hashing algorithms (PoW) which secure the network. DigiByte claims to have 15-second block timings. With DigiSpeed, DigiByte can reportedly scale onchain with 560 TPS now and aims to attain 280,000 TPS in 2035 with low fees.",

The project provides the infrastructure to create tokens backed by physical assets on the blockchain. To wit, it allows for the public verification of an asset\u2019s existence through its chain of custody via its Proof of Provenance (PoP) protocol, which makes use of the Ethereum network and the Interplanetary File System (IPFS). Digix also offers an API that enables other applications to be built on top of its asset tokenization service. Digix has 2 cryptocurrencies, Digix Gold (DGX) and DigixDAO (DGD). The company reportedly procures its gold from LBMA-approved refiners. For security, Digix includes third-party auditing from Bureau Veritas. The DGD crowdsale in Mar 2016 was the first crowdsale and major DAO hosted on the Ethereum network.",

It also powers real applications via social apps like Steemit. \n\nSteem started out as the cryptocurrency on the Steemit platform that rewards users for community building through the upvoting and the posting of meaningful content. Founded in 2016 by Ned Scott and BitShares creator Dan Larimer, the Steemit platform, built atop the Steem blockchain, is a social media network that seeks to be a source of community-driven curated content such as news, Q&A and job boards. The more value a particular piece of content is able to deliver across a greater number of people, the greater the reward received by the creator. Steemit users can cast votes to create a hierarchy of content. The higher the upvote count received on a content piece, the more Steem is earned by its publisher. Steemit\u2019s meritocratic system also enables users that hold more currency to cast more meaningful, greater influence votes. ",

Waves Platform describes itself as an open network for Web 3.0 applications and custom decentralized solutions, with a range of purpose-designed tools for making the process of developing and running dApps easy and accessible. Launched in 2016, Waves has since released several blockchain-based solutions. Waves\u2019 technology is designed to address the needs of developers and companies that want to leverage the properties of blockchain systems \u2013 including their security, auditability, verifiability and the trustless execution of transactions and business logic.\r\n\r\nWaves Platform claims to provide everything required to support the backend of Web 3.0 services. In 2017, Waves launched its mainnet with LPoS, decentralized exchange DEX, and later the Waves-NG protocol. In 2018, the Waves development team delivered the first implementation of smart contracts. This was followed by the release of the RIDE programming language in 2019, Strightforward, Predictible and Failproof language for programming logic. In June 2019 the mainnet of Waves Enterprise, a global private blockchain solution, was launched. All of this is complemented with a broad infrastructure: an IDE for sandbox development, tools, SDKs, libraries, frameworks, and protocols for convenient and easy integrations.\r\n\r\nWaves Platform consists of three core layers:\r\n\r\nProtocol layer: LPoS, Waves-NG, fixed fees, easy mining start, various transactions models\r\n\r\nInfrastructure layer: Keeper for private key management, IDE for sandbox development, smart-contracts programming language RIDE and other tools for dApp development, API\u2019s, libraries, tools, and frameworks.\r\n\r\nApplication layer: basic core open-source apps (decentralized exchange, mobile apps, and voting) and various dApps running on the network.",

With Zcoin\u2019s Sigma feature, only the sender and receiver would be able to ascertain the exchange of funds in a given transaction, as no transaction histories are linked to the actual coins.

The project aims to be an alternative to centralized cloud service providers with its lower price point and open-source community of developers. The Golem network pools global computing power and enables users to access these resources with GNT. Token holders pay resource owners to complete tasks requiring computational resources. The network is composed of the aggregated power of user devices. Golem is reportedly able to compute tasks that run the gamut from CGI rendering to machine learning. Transactions between participants are deemed to be safe because computations take place in sandbox environments that are sequestered from hosts\u2019 systems.",

Designed to solve peer to peer transfer of value, Nano aims to revolutionize the world economy through an ultrafast and fee-less network that is open and accessible to everyone. \r\n\r\nNano is reportedly able to offer fast and feeless transactions due to the Block Lattice - a data structure in which all accounts each have their own blockchain, rather than competing with others on a central chain. Consensus is generated through representative voting, where accounts can freely choose their representative at any time with an update of their account chain, thereby providing more control for users to decide who validates transactions.\r\n\r\nEach component of the protocol was created with the long term goals of decentralization and accessibility in mind. By creating a system where representatives are not paid to operate, the incentive to participate in the network is shifted to indirect, operational cost savings. The team claims that this change in incentive model is more efficient and removes one of the factors driving centralization in other systems because participants are not encouraged to interact beyond their direct needs and supporting the network, and thus economies of scale become less critical.",

By providing on-demand access to cloud computing resources, iExec is reportedly able to support compute-intensive applications in fields such as AI, big data, healthcare, rendering, or FinTech.\r\n\r\nThe iExec network is made up of computing resource providers. Computing power providers are called \u2018iExec Workers\u2019. As workers, users can connect their machines and be rewarded in RLC tokens for contributing resources to the network. Application providers can monetize their applications and algorithms. Data providers who own valuable datasets can make them available for use by applications through iExec. The iExec consensus protocol \u2018PoCo\u2019 (Proof of Contribution) provides consensus over off-chain computing and can also be used to integrate decentralized oracles with iExec.\r\n\t\r\niExec believes that its strength lies in trusted off-chain computing. Its representative heads the \u2018Trusted Compute Working\u2019 group within the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance. It has partnered with Intel to release a 'trusted compute' solution for blockchain (TEE using Intel SGX).  Other iExec collaborators include Alibaba Cloud, IBM, Genesis Cloud, EDF electrical utility company, EEA, and Ubisoft. iExec was one of the contributors to the Trusted Compute Framework (Hyperledger Avalon) alongside Microsoft, Intel, ConsenSys, Envision, PegaSys, and Kaleido. \r\n\r\niExec is working with various organizations and consortiums with the goal of providing scalable, secure and easy access to the services, datasets, and computing resources.",

        "description": "Chainlink (LINK) is a decentralized oracle service, which aims to connect smart contracts with data from the real world. Since blockchains cannot access data outside their network, oracles are needed to function as data feeds in smart contracts. Oracles provide external data (e.g. temperature, weather) that trigger smart contract executions upon the fulfillment of pre-defined conditions. Participants on the Chainlink network are incentivized (through rewards) to provide smart contracts with access to external data feeds. Should users desire access to off-chain data, they can submit a requesting contract to ChainLink\u2019s network. These contracts will match the requesting contract with the appropriate oracles. The contracts include a reputation contract, an order-matching contract, and an aggregating contract. The aggregating contract gathers data of the selected oracles to find the most accurate result.",

It is reportedly the first blockchain platform to evolve out of a scientific philosophy and a research-first driven approach, and one of the first to be built in the Haskell programming language. Cardano is developing a smart contract platform which seeks to deliver more advanced features than any protocol previously developed.  The development team consists of a large global collective of expert engineers and researchers. The protocol reportedly features a layered blockchain software stack that is flexible, scalable, and is being developed with the most rigorous academic and commercial software standards in the industry. Cardano will use a democratic governance system that allows the project to evolve over time, and fund itself sustainably through a treasury system.",

It aims to combine a self-correcting protocol and on-chain governance to manage network modifications. Tezos is powered by XTZ, which is created through 'baking'. Bakers put up deposits and are rewarded for signing and publishing blocks. Witnesses then validate the blocks. Dishonest bakers lose their XTZ deposits. Tezos uses delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) and supports Turing complete smart contracts. Tezos is implemented in the OCaml programming language, which is said to offer 'functional, imperative, and object-oriented styles'.",

        "description": "Introduced in 2017, Zilliqa (ZIL) is centered around the idea of 'Sharding' and was designed to enhance the scalability of cryptocurrency networks such as Ethereum. Sharding is analogous to the concept of 'divide and conquer', where transactions are divided into smaller groups for miners to perform parallel transactional verification. The upshot of this is the ability to reach consensus more quickly, which would increase the number of transactions in a given period. According to the white paper, transactions speed could scale to approximately 1000x that of Ethereum's network. Zilliqa\u2019s high throughput means that developers can focus on fleshing out their ideas rather than worrying about network congestion. ",

        "description": "Holochain (HOT) is a decentralized application platform that uses peer-to-peer networking for processing agent-centric agreement and consensus mechanisms between users. In Holochain, no true global consensus is maintained. Instead, each agent in the public blockchain maintains a private fork that is managed and stored in a limited way on the public blockchain with a distributed hash table. This enables every device on a network to function independently, and only requires the synchronization of data when necessary, or agreed upon by users. This could translate into higher scalability for dapps hosted on Holochain. The Holo ecosystem relies on hosts that provide processing and storage for distributed applications while earning redeemable credits. Holochain Dapps can be developed with JavaScript or Lisp, with support for front-end systems using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.",

The main goal of the project is to facilitate fast, anonymous, and untraceable transactions. Bytecoin claims to be the first project to implement CryptoNote technology. Its security reportedly comes from using ring signatures to protect a sender's identity and unlinkable addresses to prevent blockchain analysis. Bytecoin claims to have a block time of 2 minutes and adaptive parameters that are designed to make it easy to mine. Recent additions to Bytecoin technology include Auditable Wallets, which reportedly enables secure, publicly observable deposits, and Blockchain Gateways, a means of connecting Bytecoin's blockchain with other blockchains.",

Stellar aims to help facilitate cross-asset transfer of value at a fraction of a penny while aiming to be an open financial system that gives people of all income levels access to low-cost financial services. Stellar can handle exchanges between fiat-based currencies and between cryptocurrencies. Stellar.org, the organization that supports Stellar, is centralized like XRP and meant to handle cross platform transactions and micro transactions like XRP. However, unlike Ripple, Stellar.org is non-profit and their platform itself is open source and decentralized. Through the use of its intermediary currency Lumens (XLM), a user can send any currency that they own to anyone else in a different currency. \r\n\r\nStellar was founded by Jed McCaleb in 2014. Jed McCaleb is also the founder of Mt. Gox and co-founder of Ripple, launched the network system Stellar with former lawyer Joyce Kim. Stellar is also a payment technology that aims to connect financial institutions and drastically reduce the cost and time required for cross-border transfers. In fact, both payment networks used the same protocol initially.",

Transaction speed on Verge is estimated to be at 5 seconds due to the use of Simple Payment Verification (SPV). The Core QT wallet has built-in TOR integration and SSL encryption which obfuscates the IP addresses of users. The introduction of the Wraith Protocol upgrade enables users to send and receive payments privately across the Verge blockchain by enabling stealth addressing services. Verge users are reportedly able to switch between private and public ledgers on the Verge blockchain.
